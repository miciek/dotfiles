# dotfiles
This repo contains all my settings and scripts used in day-to-day electronic life. The basic setup:
- Lubuntu 16.04 with i3 and oh-my-zsh
- Mac OSX with iTerm2 and oh-my-zsh

There are also some scripts used to mount backup local ftp server and remote shell.

The files in this repository are used to automatically provision my workstation from scratch. See [my-machine-provisioning repo](https://github.com/miciek/my-machine-provisioning) for more information.
